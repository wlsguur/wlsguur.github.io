I'm a Ph.D. student in [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/), Seoul, South Korea, advised by Prof. [Seungryong Kim](https://cvlab.kaist.ac.kr/members/faculty). My main research interest is **3D Vision** and **Generative Models**.

Prior to joining KAIST, I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/), Seoul, South Korea.
